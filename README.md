### Movies and Series Recommender to PLEX
In this code we create a recommendation model.
We used a dataset called "Netflix Dataset Latest 2021" which was donwload in Kaggle.


How the code works?
=============
You have bouth options.

The first, you can work with an ID and put it after the box called iloc.

The second and more recommendable is that users write the movie name and after this the model show them the five results. It can be the best option because you can not select a movie before the user use the portal.

How to install it?
============
In this case depends of your server or your website.
The first option is create an API and call the model when a user select a movie or serie to show it five movies.
The other option is add the code in your website code in your own server.
